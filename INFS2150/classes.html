                <p class="bottomspacer">
                    While there is no specific worldwide governing body for the Highland games, the majority of organizations have a base set of classes that
                    athletes fit into. The classes exist to provide an even playing field for athletes of different ages, genders, and skill levels. In some cases,
                    the classes will have throwing implements that are heavier or lighter than another classes' implements.
                </p>
                <p>For more details on the varying weights of the implements, more information is available <a href="throws.html">here</a>.</p>
                <h4>Primary Classes</h4>
                <ul class="classlist">
                    <li>Pro - Men's only, invite only class. Prize money is awarded and travel accomdoations are provided.</li>
                    <li>Amateur - Men younger than 40.</li>

                <p>
                    In addition to the above primary classes, there are some secondary classes. While nearly every competition
                    in the world will have the primary classes, using the varied secondary classes below are up to the discretion of
                    the competition's athletic director. There are so many secondary classes out there that the below list only shows a sample portion.
                </p>
                <h4>Secondary Classes</h4>
