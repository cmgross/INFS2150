                    <h1>What are the Scottish Highland Games?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The origins of the very diverse Scottish Heavy Athletic events have been lost in the shadows of time but almost certainly date back to the very early Celtic peoples.
                        Whenever tribes or clans gathered to barter or sell their goods or at festival times, informal contests of strength, agility and endurance between the men were also held.
                        Being farmers as well as warriors, these athletic contests were based on similar activities utilizing the items at hand.
                        Clan chiefs would use these contests to select the best men for his men at arms and couriers.
                        In ancient times, standing armies in the Celtic Nations were very rare, causing the defense of the country to fall upon warriors supplied by clans or tribes.
                        To this end, King Malcolm III Canmore held the first organized highland games at Braemar in 1057.
                        During the 1800's, Sir Walter Scott's novels sparked a revival of interest in things Scottish.
                        New Highland Games were organized, with their emphasis shifted towards a purely sporting activity.
                        In order to compete in these traditional events, every athlete is required to wear a kilt except for the novice first-time competitors.
                        The following are some of the modern day competition events that you might see at any of the many Scottish Highland Games around the United States.
                        These competitions require great strength, agility and endurance of the athletes competing for honors and prizes.
